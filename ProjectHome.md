tacow - pronounced 'taco' and always spelled in lower-case - is the first international chapter of Cocoaheads, a network of Mac OS X developer groups.

Our goal is to foster a community of Apple technology developers. We wanted a venue to give and receive presentations and share war stories, interesting tech notes, hacks, and general geek stuff, without having to wait for WWDC.

Here on Google Code, we'll be posting sample projects from presentations at tacow meetings, plus any other useful stuff we come across.
